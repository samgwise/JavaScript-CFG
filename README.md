# JavaScript::CFG
*JavaScript Constant Function Grafter*

**A perl6 module for grafting constant functions into JavaScript source code.**

Grafting functions to JavaScript provides a simple solution for adding information to a scripts environment. This is an alternative to substituting placeholders with values from the server.
By passing our values via a JavaScript function we allow the script to use the values as any other function might be used in the language. In addition it provides a structured interface
for providing values to a JavaScript.

**Why might I use this?**
* To provide additional environment information to a client side script
